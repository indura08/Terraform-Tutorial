✅ What is an Internet Gateway in AWS?
---------------------------------------

An Internet Gateway (IGW) is like a door that connects your AWS VPC to the internet.

Without it, your EC2 instance (or anything inside your VPC) cannot connect to the internet or be accessed from the internet.

💡 Why do we need it?
=======================

If you want your EC2 instance to:

Run apt update, npm install, or curl → ✅ You need internet access.

Be accessible via a public IP (like from your browser) → ✅ You need an IGW.

So, Internet Gateway = Internet Access.

✅ What is a Route Table in AWS?
---------------------------------

A Route Table in AWS is a set of rules (called routes) that control where network traffic goes inside your VPC.

🧠 Think of it like this:

Every subnet in a VPC uses a route table.

A route tells the subnet:

👉 "Hey, if traffic is going to this IP range, send it here."

🧾 A default route table might contain something like:

| Destination   | Target  |
| ------------- | ------- |
| `10.0.0.0/16` | `local` |

That means:
👉 All traffic that stays inside the VPC (e.g., between subnets) will be routed locally.


🆚 What is a Custom Route Table?
===================================
A Custom Route Table is one you create manually, instead of using the default one.

You create a custom route table when:

You want to control which subnet can access the internet.

You want to route traffic to a NAT Gateway, VPN, or Internet Gateway (IGW).

You want to make different parts of your VPC behave differently.

📦 Example: Making a subnet public
Let’s say you want your EC2 instance to access the internet. You would:

Create an Internet Gateway (IGW).

Create a custom route table.

Add a route like this:

| Destination | Target             |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| `0.0.0.0/0` | `igw-xxxxxxxxxxxx` |


👉 This means:
"All internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) goes through the Internet Gateway."

📌 Summary

| Term                    | What it means                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Route Table**         | Controls traffic flow inside the VPC.                               |
| **Default Route Table** | The one AWS gives your VPC automatically.                           |
| **Custom Route Table**  | One that *you* create to control traffic more specifically.         |
| **Routes**              | Rules inside the route table.                                       |
| **Subnet Association**  | A subnet must be associated with a route table (default or custom). |

✅ What is Route Table Association?

It means:
You're telling AWS:

“This subnet should use this route table to know how to reach other networks.”

In simple words:
Route Table Association = Connecting a Subnet to a Route Table

✅ Why is it Important?

Let’s say:

You have two subnets: Public and Private

You want the Public Subnet to connect to the internet

But the Private Subnet should stay internal only

You'd:

Associate the Public Subnet with a Route Table that has a rule like:

Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 → Target: igw-xxxxxx (Internet Gateway)

Associate the Private Subnet with a Route Table that doesn't have this rule.

✅ How to Associate a Route Table to a Subnet in AWS Console?

	Go to VPC Dashboard

	Click on Route Tables

	Choose your route table

	Click on “Subnet Associations”

	Click Edit subnet associations

	Choose the subnet(s) you want to link

Done!

---------------------------------------
✅ What Do "Ingress" and "Egress" Mean?
---------------------------------------

These two words are used when talking about network traffic — data going in or out of something (like your EC2 instance, subnet, or security group).

🚪 Ingress = INCOMING traffic
------------------------------

This is data coming into your resource

Example: A user visiting your website → request goes into your EC2 instance

Think:

“Who is allowed to enter (INGRESS) into my resource?”

🚪 Egress = OUTGOING traffic
-----------------------------
This is data going out from your resource

Example: Your EC2 server fetching updates from the internet → traffic leaves your EC2 instance

Think:

“Who is allowed to exit (EGRESS) from my resource?”

✅ Where You See This in AWS?
------------------------------

Mostly in Security Groups and Network ACLs (Access Control Lists).

In Security Groups, you define:

Ingress Rules → Who can access my instance? (e.g., allow HTTP or SSH)

Egress Rules → Where can my instance go? (e.g., allow all internet access)

🧠 First: What is a Network Interface (in general)?
----------------------------------------------------

Imagine your computer as a house 🏠, and the network interface is like the door 🚪 that lets you connect to the outside world (like the internet or a local network).

A network interface is like the hardware or virtual component that allows a device to send and receive data over a network.

Every network interface has:

	An IP address (like your house number 📬)

	A MAC address (like your house’s unique ID 🏷️)

	Maybe other settings like DNS, subnet, etc.

Example from your personal computer:

Your laptop connects to Wi-Fi using a wireless network interface

If you plug in an Ethernet cable, you use a wired network interface
