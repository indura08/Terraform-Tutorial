‚úÖ What is an "Instance Type" in AWS?
----------------------------------------

When you create an EC2 instance (a virtual machine), you need to choose how powerful it should be ‚Äî that means deciding:

	How much CPU (processing power)?

	How much RAM (memory)?

	What kind of performance?

That "configuration" is called the instance type.

‚úÖ Examples of Instance Types

Here are some common ones (especially free-tier friendly):

| Instance Type | vCPU | RAM  | Free Tier?            |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | --------------------- |
| `t2.micro`    | 1    | 1 GB | ‚úÖ Yes                 |
| `t3.micro`    | 2    | 1 GB | ‚úÖ Yes (in some cases) |
| `t2.small`    | 1    | 2 GB | ‚ùå No                  |
| `t3.medium`   | 2    | 4 GB | ‚ùå No                  |

So, when you choose t2.micro, you're saying:

"Give me a small virtual machine with 1 CPU and 1 GB of RAM."

üÜö t2.micro vs t3.micro ‚Äî What's the Difference?

| Feature              | `t2.micro`              | `t3.micro`                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Older Generation     | Yes                     | No (newer gen)                          |
| Performance          | OK                      | Better                                  |
| Free Tier            | Yes                     | Sometimes (depends on AWS region/promo) |
| Cost After Free Tier | Higher CPU Credits cost | More efficient billing                  |
